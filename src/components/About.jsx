        Hey there! I'm <strong>Akhilesh Pratap Singh</strong>, a web developer from IET Lucknow with a deep passion for crafting intuitive and scalable digital experiences.
        <br /><br />
        I love building full-stack web applications using technologies like <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong>, <strong>Node.js</strong>, and <strong>Django</strong>. From designing elegant frontends to architecting backend systems, I enjoy the entire development journey.
        <br /><br />
        I'm currently working on a real-world <strong>milk delivery system</strong> designed to handle subscriptions, wallet payments, and admin-side controlsâ€”something I'm proud to have built from scratch.
        <br /><br />
        Besides development, I actively contribute to the <strong>Training & Placement Cell</strong> of my college, where I handle student coordination and corporate communications.
        <br /><br />
        Always learning. Always building. Letâ€™s connect and create something amazing!
